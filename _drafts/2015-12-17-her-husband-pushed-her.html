<p>原文：</p>
<p>Her husband pushed her after taking her to a height, despite her continuous pleading and requests.</p>
<p>She ended up enjoying a swing for the first time and wondered why was she ever scared of it.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>译文：</p>
<p>她的丈夫把她拉到高处，然后狠狠地推了一把，完全无视她不停地哀求和拒绝。</p>
<p>荡秋千原来这么好玩，以前到底怕个什么劲儿啊。:)</p>
