<p>原文：</p>
<p>She ran like crazy , praying none of them would catch up with her, as thousands of eyes were watching all around her.</p>
<p>She only stopped when she reached the finish-line as the winner of the marathon.</p>
<p>译文：</p>
<p>她发疯一般地狂奔，心里祈祷可以甩掉追赶她的那些人，而四周有成千上万只眼睛盯着她。</p>
<p>直到越过那条终点线，她才停了下来，这场马拉松的冠军诞生了。</p>
