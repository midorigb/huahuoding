<p>原文</p>
<p>"You ruined my career, I was supposed to be an executive director," she thought to herself.</p>
<p>The little angel held her finger tightly and she forgot everything; A mother was born.</p>
<p>译文</p>
<p>&ldquo;你毁了我的事业，我原本可以成为前途一片光明的管理者！&rdquo;她心中默念。</p>
<p>小小天使柔软的小手指轻轻抓住了她，一切都不重要了，一个伟大的母亲就此诞生。</p>
